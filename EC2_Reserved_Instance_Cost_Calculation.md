# AWS EC2 Reserved Instance Cost Calculation

The cost of a reserved EC2 instance on AWS depends on several factors, including the instance type, region, and payment option (All Upfront, Partial Upfront, or No Upfront). Below is a general idea of how you can calculate it.

## 1. Instance Type
For a 2 CPU and 8GB memory instance, the closest match is the `t3a.large` or `t3.large` instance type. However, if you need a different type, make sure to specify it.

## 2. Region
The cost varies by region. Let's assume `us-east-1` (Northern Virginia).

## 3. Pricing Options
AWS offers three main pricing options for reserved instances:
- **All Upfront**: You pay the entire cost upfront.
- **Partial Upfront**: You pay part of the cost upfront and the rest monthly.
- **No Upfront**: You pay monthly without any upfront cost.

## 4. Example Calculation
Let's take the `t3a.large` instance type in the `us-east-1` region with All Upfront payment for a 1-year reserved instance.

As of the latest pricing (please check the current AWS pricing page for the most up-to-date information), the cost for a `t3a.large` instance with All Upfront payment in `us-east-1` is approximately:

- **t3a.large (2 vCPUs, 8 GB memory)**
  - 1-year All Upfront: $292.00 USD
  - 1-year Partial Upfront: $157.00 USD upfront + $15.15 USD/month
  - 1-year No Upfront: $18.78 USD/month

## Monthly Cost Calculation
For the All Upfront option:
- Total Cost for 1 Year: $292.00
- Monthly Cost: $292.00 / 12 = $24.33

For the Partial Upfront option:
- Upfront Cost: $157.00
- Monthly Cost: $15.15
- Total Monthly Cost: ($157.00 / 12) + $15.15 = $28.23

For the No Upfront option:
- Monthly Cost: $18.78

## Summary
- **All Upfront**: ~$24.33 per month
- **Partial Upfront**: ~$28.23 per month
- **No Upfront**: ~$18.78 per month
