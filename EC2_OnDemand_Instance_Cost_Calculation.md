# AWS EC2 On-Demand Instance Cost Calculation





The cost of an on-demand EC2 instance on AWS depends on the instance type, region, and usage. Below is a general idea of how you can calculate it.

## 1. Instance Type
For a 2 CPU and 8GB memory instance, the closest match is the `t3a.large` or `t3.large` instance type. However, if you need a different type, make sure to specify it.

## 2. Region
The cost varies by region. Let's assume `us-east-1` (Northern Virginia).

## 3. On-Demand Pricing
On-demand instances are charged by the hour or second, depending on the instance type. AWS pricing as of the latest update (please check the current AWS pricing page for the most up-to-date information):

- **t3a.large (2 vCPUs, 8 GB memory)**
  - On-Demand: $0.0672 per Hour

## Monthly Cost Calculation
Assuming a month has approximately 730 hours:

- Hourly Cost: $0.0672
- Monthly Cost: $0.0672 * 730 = $49.06

## Summary
- **On-Demand (t3a.large)**: ~$49.06 per month
